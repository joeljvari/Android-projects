# Golf Scorecard
It is to learn about activity lifecycle and SharedPreferences.

# Project Specs:

There should be a list of 18 Holes
There should be an easy way to add/subtract strokes to each hole
It should remember the scores we set (even if we close the app)
It should contain a 'Clear Strokes' button which will reset all stroke counts to 0
