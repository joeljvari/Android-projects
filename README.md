Golf Scorecard
================

It is to learn about activity lifecycle and SharedPreferences.

Project Specs:
---------------

1. There should be a list of 18 Holes
2. There should be an easy way to add/subtract strokes to each hole
3. It should remember the scores we set (even if we close the app)
4. It should contain a 'Clear Strokes' button which will reset all stroke counts to 0
